 			The ABC Employee Salary and Expenditure

     This assignment  is a part of the Data Science  Machine Learning  Course  projects can be found at the main GitHub repo in tile ABC Employee Salary Expenditure
Project Intro and Objective
     The goal of the project is to discover the pattern of the Employee Income and  Spending  habit using unsupervised learning clustering  K means algorithm . 
     Based on the study objective, dataset  from the  Kaggle has been retrieved and  preprocessed  in order to In order to apply clustering algorithm  

Methods Used
•	K Means Clustering algorithm 
•	K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
Technologies
•	Python
•	Jupiter Notebook /Panda
•	Scikit-learn library

Project Description
The ABC Employee Salary and Expenditure dataset  contains six hindered rows and six columns. It is out sourced from  
“Kaggle: Your Machine Learning and Data Science Community Website” , I found the dataset interesting to apply the unsupervised machine learning algorithm  particularly K Means algorithm. to study the pattern of the individual salaries  and their respective expenditure habits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I found the  K means algorithm  more  advantageous compare to the K  Nearest Neighbors  which I uses  for classification of data . I found the K means algorithm It is the fastest and most efficient algorithm to categorize data points into groups.It is also  simple to implement, scales to large data sets  and haven’t gotten problems to study the spending habit of the employees . However, its performance is usually not as competitive as those of the other sophisticated clustering techniques because slight variations in the data could lead to high variance.
In this project  K Means was used to study  to classify and form clusters . to this effect, Elbow method was used to find out the  size of “K” equal to  5 to place similar  cluster together and data points in the different clusters are farther apart.
